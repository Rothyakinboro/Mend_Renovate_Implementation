## Introduction

Developers often face significant challenges when updating dependencies, which can negatively impact code pipelines, degrade application performance, introduce security vulnerabilities, and consume unnecessary time and resources. These issues often result in avoidable costs for businesses. Mend Renovate is an open-source SaaS tool that helps developers automate dependency updates by detecting newer package versions and providing updates directly to the application code. This document outlines simple steps to implement Mend Renovate.

## Project Scope

This guide covers the following steps:

- Installing Mend Renovate on GitHub through the GitHub Marketplace
- Registering with Mend Renovate
- Adding Mend Renovate to a repository
- Creating a pull request to add the Renovate configuration file (renovate.json) and allowing Mend Renovate to scan the repository
- Accepting suggested version updates by merging Mend Renovate pull requests
- Customizing the Renovate configuration (optional)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
- A GitHub account
- A Mend Renovate account
- A repository containing source code, such as Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, or GitHub workflows

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Install Mend Renovate via GitHub Marketplace

1. Navigate to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).
2. Search for "Mend Renovate" in the search bar.
3. Select **Add**, then choose the repository where you want to install Mend Renovate.

### Step 2: Register with Mend Renovate

1. Provide your personal information to complete the registration process.
2. Once registered, a dashboard will be created for you on the Mend platform.
3. Use this dashboard to monitor your repositories and add additional repositories in the future.

### Step 3: Add Mend Renovate to Your Repository

1. Accept the pull request generated by Mend Renovate to configure the tool.
2. During this step, source code files requiring version updates will already be highlighted.

### Step 4: Scan and Update Dependencies

1. Mend Renovate will perform a scan of your repository.
2. It will create multiple branches for each detected dependency update.
3. Each branch will describe the specific version update for a dependency.

### Step 5: Merge Renovate Branches

1. Create a pull request to merge the Renovate branch containing the updates.
2. After merging, delete the branch to keep your repository clean.

### Optional: Customize Renovate Configuration

- You can modify the renovate.json file to customize the behavior of Mend Renovate according to your project's needs. For example, you can define:
  - Schedule for updates
  - Specific package rules
  - Dependency grouping

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can effectively implement Mend Renovate in your repositories to automate dependency updates, enhance code quality, and reduce manual overhead. The tool not only simplifies dependency management but also ensures your projects remain secure, up-to-date, and efficient.
